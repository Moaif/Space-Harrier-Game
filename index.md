## Objective
I've started this proyect as a UPC videogame master task, which challenge us to make a "replica" of an old racing game from a list of them. In my case, I've chossen Space-Harrier (and yes, it's considered as racing game).

## Game Info
Space Harrier (Japanese: スペースハリアー Hepburn: Supēsu Hariā) is an arcade video game developed and released by Sega Enterprises in December 1985. Originally conceived as a realistic military-themed game played in the third-person perspective and featuring a player-controlled fighter jet, technical and memory restrictions at the time resulted in Sega developer Yu Suzuki redesigning it to fit a fantasy setting centered around a jet-propelled human character.[Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Harrier)
